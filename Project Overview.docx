						Project Overview
	
1) Our goal is to create a browser based slide puzzle game. 

2) Slide puzzles are fun little distractions that many of us enjoyed growing up.  Creating a browser based slide puzzle seems to us, a feasible problem to solve and one that will allow us to adequately appreciate the principles of sound software engineering methodology.  

3) Our tech stack will include HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the frontend, MySQL for the database component, and Java (or PHP?) for the backend.

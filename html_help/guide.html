        Slyyde puzzles consist of a grid of tiles whose positions have been randomized. When organized the correct way, the tiles will form a picture. There is always one empty tile in the grid. Adjacent tiles can be moved into the empty space, leaving a new empty space where the tile that was just moved was. The goal of the game is to re-create the picture by moving the tiles around in the quickest and least moves you can.
